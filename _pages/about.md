I am Haiwen Huang, my Chinese name is 黄海文. I am a PhD student at University of Tübingen, co-supervised by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](http://www.cvlibs.net/) and [Dr. Dan Zhang](https://www.bosch-ai.com/research/researcher-pages/t_overviewpage_133.html), starting in Jan. 2022. 

My research interests span robust machine learning, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution detection, and out-of-distribution generalization. More generally, I am interested in problems that machine learning faces when we deploy it in the real-world applications, e.g., large-scale annotation, AI alignment, small-data tasks.

Before my PhD studies, I completed my MSc in CS at University of Oxford (supervisor: Prof. Yarin Gal) and my BSc in Math at Peking University (supervisor: Prof. Bin Dong). I have also worked as a researcher for a year at Megvii (previously known as Face++), studying large-scale annotation and OoD detection methods.

My CV is [here](https://andrehuang.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
