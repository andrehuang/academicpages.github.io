I am Haiwen Huang, my Chinese name is 黄海文. I am a PhD student at University of Tübingen, co-supervised by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](http://www.cvlibs.net/) and [Dr. Dan Zhang](https://www.bosch-ai.com/research/researcher-pages/t_overviewpage_133.html), starting in Jan. 2022. I am also an [ELLIS PhD student](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc).

My career goal is to empower industry with AI to boost the producitivity of human society. To achieve this, we need AI systems to be **trustworthy and powerful in various environments**. 
- To be trustworthy, the AI systems need to be able to tell when they are unreliable (**OOD detection**); 
- To be powerful, the AI systems need to be robust to the (unseen) changes of the environments and domains (**OOD generalization**). 

In order to achieve generalization to unseen objects and environments, a model requires additional information that is invariant across categories and domains. My PhD studies aim to explore methods for **incorporating knowledge from pretrained large models to achieve out-of-distribution generalization in various tasks**. 

I believe that using large pretrained models (e.g. Omnidata models and Stable Diffusion) will significantly reduce the cost of AI development and deployment while improving the overall well-being of the world.

Before my PhD studies, I completed my MSc in CS at University of Oxford (supervisor: [Prof. Yarin Gal](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yarin.gal/website/)) and my BSc in Math at Peking University (supervisor: [Prof. Bin Dong](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/)). I have also worked as a researcher for a year at Megvii (previously known as Face++), studying large-scale annotation and OoD detection methods.

My CV is [here](https://andrehuang.github.io/files/HaiwenHuang_CV.pdf).
